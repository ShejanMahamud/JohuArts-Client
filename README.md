# Problem Faced and Solution

**Problem**: Implementing secure user authentication and authorization for managing artworks and profiles.

**Solution**: Utilized Firebase Authentication for robust user authentication, enabling both social login options and email/password-based login and registration. Implemented private routes in React to ensure that only authenticated users can access specific pages like managing artworks or updating profiles. This approach ensured security and user privacy while maintaining a seamless user experience.
